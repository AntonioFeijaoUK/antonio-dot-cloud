## Antonio Feijao UK

![Antonio Feijao UK](../assets/images/Antonio_Feijao_cover_photo.jpg)

Hi, my name is Antonio Feijao and I am originally from Portugal.

Living in London, United Kingdom, working as `Solutions Architect` for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).


## What Solutions Architect do?

* <https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/job_categories/solutions-architect>

* <https://youtu.be/IBqqYWr4t94> - "What's It Like to Be a Solution Architect at AWS? Hear from Our Very Own."

* <https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/working/working-amazon>

* <https://www.simplilearn.com/what-a-day-in-the-life-of-an-aws-solutions-architect-look-like-article>

Good explanation on the site above, with except on the following sentence: 

> <s>"Some AWS Solutions Architects are focused more on products and not on the customers."</s>


At AWS and Amazon, the companies culture starts with the customer. We would prioritize the customer instead of the product.
