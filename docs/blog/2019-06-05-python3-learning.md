## Python 3 learning for the first time

I have a background in `shell scripting`, so when I had to automate something, `bash scripting` would do the job just fine!

I also want to learn Python becayse is widely use nowadys and easy to integrate in most [AWS Services](...link), specifically useful for events with [Lambda in AWS](...link...).

Took me a while to do something usefull with Python 3. At first, seemed an easy language to learn, and I still think it is!

If you already started first steeps, you know you  can easily do print a `print ("Hello World")`, and you probably learnd a difference on the `print` command. From *Python 2* to ***Python 3***, you now have to use the parentises `( ... )`...

Just the command `print` is not enough to make something useful.

I thought that there might be someone else out there struggling to get started in Python 3, so I decided to share my experince on "How I start learning Python 3 and doing something useful".

You can execute command directly from running the command python3

```python
CommandLine $ > python3
Python 3.7.4 (default, Jul  9 2019, 18:13:23)
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print ("Hello World for AntonioCloud.com")
Hello World for AntonioCloud.com
>>>
>>> exit()
CommandLine $ >
CommandLine $ >
```

Then, I installed `ipython` and practice from there, but I was still on the basics commands and wanted to learn more.

## Learn Python 3 on-the-go offline and mobile phone

After trying the basics, I set myself to practice on commute or free time.

Started by downloading the mobile app [SoloLearn](..link) and started to pratices while I was on commute. Some time later I  completed the course, and Hey! Actually the final certificate feels like a good and well deserved rewards for completing the corse.

Here is mine [Antonio SoloLearn Python Certificate].

## Learning by doing and practice often

So, after that, it really boosted my Python 3 skill when i started the fun project [Stranger Things Alphabet Wall Lights](Stranger Things Alphabet Wall Lights).

With a fun challenge and with some physical visual result I felt is a lot more engaging.

commandI set fun challenge, something simple that only requires `for loops`, `while loops` and
