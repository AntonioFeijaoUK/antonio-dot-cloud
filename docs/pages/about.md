## My background story

### Lisbon Portugal

Hi, my name is Antonio Feijao, born in Portugal and currently living in London, UK.

In highschool I followed the technologies path where I learned the fundamentals of Computer Science and Programing.

Then, I the pursued a 5 years University degree in [Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering](https://www.isel.pt/en/courses/master-degree/eletronis-and-telecommunications-engineering).

I did learn a lot but was very difficult for me after second year. I only had a minor background in Electronics.

**Never give up!**

So, to improve my electronics skills, while studying at the University, I also enrolled in a 3 years part-time night course in **"Telecommunications and Networking Specialization"**.

The private school was called "Forino", but since then, it changed the name to [CINEL](https://www.cinel.pt/appv2/O-CINEL/Certificacoes).

It was here that I found my passion for **Networking**. I was a student at Cisco Network Academy for 1.5 years [Cisco NetAcad](https://www.netacad.com/).

After successfully pass my CCNA Routing and Switching Cisco Exam, I got a job offer at [Unisys](https://www.unisys.com/) as a Security Consultant and [Penetration tester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test).

I was trained in many areas os security!

Here, I found another passion, **Security**! I learn best practices, tweaking and hardening configurations configurations, Windows, Linux and Networking.

I learned so much here! I actually like to learn new things every day.

As a Security Consultant, I worked with the largest organizations in Portugal in Finance, Banking.

### Luanda Angola

After 1 year experience as a Security Consultant, I was assigned to a 3 years project in Africa, Angola, City of Luanda, at the Minister of Defence.

Hand-on work, assembling racks and data centre equipment, and yes it had servers, cables, networking devices. This took about 1 months.

My responsibility included:

Year 1

- Networking configurations following the best security practices
- Monitoring and Alerting Applications
- Connecting the various cities in Angola back to the Data-Centre in Luanda. *(Some cities were connected through satellite trucks, it was great experience tweaking packets sizes, window-size and MTUs for latency improvements)*
- Networking for standalone trucks connected through satellite
- Collaborating with other teams, mostly Develops, Microsoft Administrators and the Project Managers

Year 2

- Training the various local teams that would look after the Network Infrastructure
- Continuous improvements
- Collaborating with other teams

Year 3

- Continuous improvements
- Firmware upgrades
- Training the local Engineers

I meet amazing people during my stay in Angola.

### London United Kingdom

After this project, I went back to Portugal. I learned so much in the past 5 years, but I wanted more.

Most of the technical documentation was in English. In some occasions, I had to engage with the Cisco support. I had the feeling that sometimes I was struggling with the English language.

(...)

Fast forwarding, that is why I moved to England, to work, live and improve the english language.

Living in London, United Kingdom, working as `Solutions Architect` for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

I am a Solutions Architect at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), and on my daily job, I help customer with:

- with moving their workloads into AWS

- review complex Architecture and migrations project and ,  -->work with various customer and help them with any type of architectures and the best practices in cloud.

I am am passionate with tech in generally and is a pleasure to me when I help others unfolding complex architectures.

I built this page to practice and get experience.

Good explanation on the site above, with except on the following sentence: <s>"Some AWS Solutions Architects are focused more on products and not on the customers."</s>

At Amazon and AWS, the company culture starts with **Customer Obsession**!

We prioritize the customer instead of the product. Check out Amazon Culture and Principles
